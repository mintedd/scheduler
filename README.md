# scheduler
Took moment.js and jQuery knowledge to create a daily planner.
moment.js was used for the time and jQuery was used throughout for DOM traversal and syntax. 

## User Story

I WANT to add task to my timed to-do list 
SO THAT I can manage task efficiently throughout the day
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
